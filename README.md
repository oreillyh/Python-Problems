### Fibonacci Exercises Folder
1.  Fib.py is Ians fibonacci sequence example
2.  fib1.py outputs fibonacci sequence for all numbers less than 100
3.  fib2.py Topic 1 and 2 Homework combined: Creates a function to calculate fibonacci number and also outputs the fobonacci number     calculated from the sum of the first and last letters of my surname. Use of ord() function

### Collatz Conjecture Folder
1. Collatz_HOR.py returns the sequence of the collatz conjecture when initial value is 17/n
2.  Collatz_HOR_rev1.py Collatz conjecture sequence generated from the user inputting a positive integer
3.  Collatz_HOR_v2.py returns the values of a user entered integer returning iterations of a sequence depending on whether each iteration is positive or negative. Similar to Collatz_HOR_rev1.py except  output format is tidied up

### Project Euler Exercises Folder
1.  Euler prob 2.py Project Euler Problem 2: Finds the sum of the even valued terms of the Fibonacci sequence less then 4 million.
2.  Euler_prob_5.py Project Euler Problem 5: 2520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from 1 to 10 without any remainder. What is the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to 20?
